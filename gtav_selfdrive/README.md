# Tensorflow... by example

Tensorflow in GTA V, a self-driving car

---------------

Followed guide from [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/). To use this example run GTAV in 800x600 window mode in the top left corner. Run create_training_data.py to capture the data, balance_data.py will shuffle the data. train_model.py will create the model from the data. test_model.py will run the model.

[AlexNet Paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) was used as the neural net. It uses Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.
